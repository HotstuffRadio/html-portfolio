<h1> The Best Movies According to Johnny </h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All-Time. </h2>
<hr />
<h3>Blade Runner (1982) </h3>
<p>This is my favourite movie of all time [*possibly] if not for the dystopian sci-fi atmosphere then for the amazing sci-fi dystopian soundtrack by Vangelis</p>
<h3>Last Days (2005)</h3>
<p>Gus Van Sant tackles this beautiful and tragically sad sojourn of the last days of Kurt Cobains life with an amazing sumptuos score by Hildergard Westerkamp</p>
<h3>Jaws (1975)</h3>
<p>As far as American allegorical metaphorical block busters go - this is the daddy! - Watch out the shark *Trump is coming again!</p>
