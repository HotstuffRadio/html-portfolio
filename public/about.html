<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Meet Johnny, the coder behind the mic! With a knack for crafting captivating narratives, Johnny is not just
 a podcast and code producer, theyre an absolute mess of skills; from the 
  airwaves of SoundArt radio in Totnes UK to the ancient hills of Athens, Johnny is weaving some weird magic in their
  journey through audio, code and image. Each project reflects a mosaic of multi media magic through the lens of global experiences accumulated
  over many years in the sonic visual realm.</p>

<p> and Johnnys not just about spinning boring influencer marketing tales for conservative racist sexist homophobic assholes; they love exploring the
  frontiers of sound, infusing their work with an innovative edge that blurs conventional
  notions of art with activism. This ethos produces dynamic work that delves deep into the world of art production, offering fresh 
  perspectives and insights with every project</p>
