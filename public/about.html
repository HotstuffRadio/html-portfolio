<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Meet Johnny, the coder behind the mic! With a knack for crafting captivating narratives, Johnny is not just
 a podcast and code producer, theyre an absolute mess of skills; from the 
  airwaves of SoundArt radio in Totnes UK to the ancient hills of Athens, Johnny is weaving some weird magic in their
  journey in audio, code and narratives. Each project reflects a mosaic of magic through the global experiences accumulated
  over many years in the sonic visual realm.</p>

<p>Johnnys not just about spinning boring influencer marketing tales; they love exploring the
  frontiers of sound, infusing sound work with an innovative image that blurs conventional
  notions of art with activism. This ethos produces dynamic work that delves deep into the world of the digital, offering fresh 
  perspectives and insights with every project</p>
